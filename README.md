# Practical-Machine-course-project-Writeup

we are given data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 research study participants.   
Our training data consists of accelerometer data and a label identifying the quality of the activity the participant was doing.  
Our testing data consists of accelerometer data without the identifying label. Our goal is to predict the labels for the   
test set observations.
